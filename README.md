# 👋 Hey, I’m Ajitkumar

### I’m someone who

- overthinks (in a good way)
- enjoys building things from scratch
- and is curious about how systems behave 

Research ideas in → **production-grade systems out**

### 🧠 MIDAS  
**Multi-Microservice AI Intelligence Platform**

- Architected as **independent, deployable microservices**  
- Services for ingestion, indexing, retrieval, reasoning, orchestration & inference  
- Domain-restricted intelligence with grounding, confidence scoring  
- Built to scale, isolate failures, and behave in production  
- **FastAPI • Docker  • React/Next.js**
- Deployment on Process and Progress

🧪 *Production > demos*

</td>

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🎓 Tutorly  
**Reinforcement-Learning Powered Tutoring System**

- RL decides *how* learning adapts (not just what)  
- GRPO / PPO-style optimization for session planning  
- Continuous feedback loops that learn from the learner  
- **Python • RL Agents • FastAPI • React**

📚 *Teaching machines to teach humans*

</td>

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📄 AskDocSite  
**Document Intelligence Without Ctrl+F Pain**

- Secure, multi-tenant document chat  
- Vector retrieval with strict access control  
- **FastAPI • Next.js**

📎 *Because PDFs deserve rights*

</td>

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⚙️ Full-Stack ML Systems  
**Notebook → Docker → Production**

- ML pipelines, model serving, CI/CD, monitoring  
- Dockerized FastAPI backends + modern frontends  
- Reliability, observability & scale first  

🚀 *If it can’t deploy, it doesn’t count*

I like building things that make sense,  breaking them until they don’t, and then fixing them so they survive real users.

I enjoy learning, shipping, and slowly trusting my code again.

<h1>Currently Obsessing Over</h1>

</div>

- Advanced **Reinforcement Learning** (PPO, GRPO, Actor-Critic, multi-agent RL)  
- **LLM systems engineering** — agents, memory, tools & guardrails  
- **MLOps & DevOps** so models don’t panic under traffic  
- Designing AI platforms that prefer **facts over vibes**
